# latinstudy

Helps to study latin declensions/vocabulary
- For my latin course because when you're looking for something specific, the book feels big, cluttered, and cumbersome to flip through (and I don't like Quizlet)
- Made by me for me, but if you want to use it, sure :) It's hosted [here](https://pineapplerind.xyz/latinstudy)

If running locally, use scripts/run.sh to build and run (you may need to `chmod +x scripts/run.sh` if permission denied)
